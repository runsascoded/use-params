/**
 * `datesParam`: a set of ISO dates in a URL, contracted to runs.
 *
 * The naive encoding of a week is ~90 chars of mostly redundant digits
 * (`?c=2026-08-18%2C…%2C2026-08-24`); this says the same in 9
 * (`?c=260818-24`). Three compressions, in order of how much they buy:
 *
 * 1. **Runs contract.** Calendar-consecutive days collapse to `start-end`.
 *    A week costs one token regardless of its length — and a week is the
 *    common case.
 * 2. **Digits are inherited.** Each token drops the leading digits it
 *    shares with the one before it: `260731 0805 24-25` is Jul 31, Aug 5,
 *    Aug 24–25 of 2026. A token is 2 (day), 4 (month-day), 6 (2-digit
 *    year), or 8 digits (full year, escape hatch for outside 2000–2099).
 *    The first token is never abbreviated.
 * 3. **The separator is a space.** `URLSearchParams` writes it as `+` and
 *    reads it back as a space, so the URL bar shows `?c=260731+0805+24-25`
 *    with nothing escaped. Decode also accepts a literal `+`, in case
 *    something hands the raw query string over un-decoded.
 *
 * Canonical form is sorted ascending and deduped — a URL is a cache key
 * and a thing people diff by eye. Empty set ⇒ `undefined` (param absent).
 *
 * Decoding is deliberately lenient: an unparseable token is skipped, not
 * thrown. This is a hand-editable URL and a typo should cost one day's
 * state rather than white-screening the page.
 *
 * ## Half-open ranges
 *
 * Pass `latest` and/or `genesis` to make ranges that touch the domain's
 * ends drop that end from the URL:
 *
 * - `latest`: a run whose *end* matches it encodes as `start-` (trailing
 *   dash). `?c=260818-` = "Aug 18 through today", and "today" is resolved
 *   fresh on every decode — so the URL keeps meaning "through today" as
 *   the calendar moves.
 * - `genesis`: a run whose *start* matches it encodes as `-end` (leading
 *   dash). `?c=-260824` = "from the beginning of the domain through Aug
 *   24".
 *
 * Both accept a `string` (fixed) or a `() => string` (resolved lazily on
 * each encode/decode). Encoded strings written without a matching option
 * decode to nothing — a half-open token with no anchor is a lenient
 * skip, same as any other malformed token.
 *
 * Single-day selections that land on `latest` or `genesis` still encode
 * as a single date (`260826`), never as `260826-` or `-260826` — a
 * lone-dash suffix on a single day would just be noise.
 *
 * The 6-digit `YYMMDD` form is a Y2K-shaped decision: it hard-codes the
 * 21st century. Dates outside 2000–2099 fall back to the 8-digit form
 * (`19991231 21000101`) — that path is untested by daily use, so treat it
 * as the escape hatch it is.
 *
 * Values are ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` strings, not `Date`s: `Date` is a timestamp
 * and a selected *day* is not one — round-tripping through `Date` invites
 * exactly the local-vs-UTC bug this param exists to avoid. Consumers who
 * want `Date`s can map.
